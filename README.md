# Data Structure & Algorithms in Java

## Project Overview
This project is dedicated to relearning Java data structures and algorithms. The focus is on implementing fundamental data structures and algorithmic concepts in Java to reinforce understanding and improve problem-solving skills.

## Features
- Implementation of various **data structures** such as:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
  - Stacks
  - Queues (Simple, Circular, Priority)
  - Hash Tables
  - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Heaps)
  - Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)
